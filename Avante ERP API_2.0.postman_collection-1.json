The response body will be in JSON format and may include the following fields:\n\n- **status** (string): Indicates the status of the request.\n    \n- **token** (string): The newly generated access token.\n    \n- **refresh_token** (string): The refresh token that can be used for future requests.\n    \n\n#### Example Response Body:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"status\": \"\",\n  \"token\": \"\",\n  \"refresh_token\": \"\"\n}\n\n ```\n\n### Related Responses\n\nIn addition to the primary response, the API may return related responses for other methods called at the same URL, which typically include:\n\n- **success** (boolean): Indicates whether the request was successful.\n    \n- **message** (string): A message providing additional information about the request.\n    \n- **data** (object): Contains user-specific information such as:\n    \n    - **api_user_id** (string): The unique identifier for the user.\n        \n    - **name** (string): The name of the user.\n        \n    - **username** (string): The username of the user.\n        \n    - **token** (string): The access token.\n        \n\n**Example Related Response**:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"message\": \"\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"api_user_id\": \"\",\n    \"name\": \"\",\n    \"username\": \"\",\n    \"token\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n### Notes\n\n- Ensure that the refresh token provided is valid; otherwise, the request may fail, and an appropriate error message will be returned.\n    \n- The structure of the response may vary slightly based on the outcome of the request, but the fields mentioned above are commonly included."
